  icon: fas fa-user
  intro: >-
    I love programming because it gives me the opportunity to build something new, as well as to analyze what already exists, disassemble it and understand how it works.
    My first approach to programming was self-taught. 
    I programmed for fun from high school until graduated with a degree in mathematics.
    I decided to improve my computer science basics by resuming my studies. 
    Today my main passion has become my job and the curiosity and desire for discovery are still the same.
